This project is used to analyze recidivism bias in the popular COMPAS dataset. The motivation for this project came from the 
ProPublica article https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm. Using Aequitas, I attempted
to mitigate the bias of the controversial dataset with varying results. See the .ipnyb file to explore for yourself. The final written
paper is also available for those interested.
